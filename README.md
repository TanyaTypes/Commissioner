# Commissioner
Commissioner is a variable and static sans typeface.

## Basic Information
Commissioner is a humanist sans-serif with almost classical proportions, conceived as a variable family. In essence it is an experiment on a low-contrast distant relative of Optima. The family consists of three “voices”. As the flare axis grows the straight grotesque terminals develop a swelling and joints become more idiosyncratic. The volume axis transforms the glyphic serifs to wedge-like ones. 

Each voice of Commissioner comes in a range of styles from Thin to Black including italics. The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes. 

Commissioner supports the Google Latin Plus and Google Latin Pro character sets.
Further expansions to scripts support include Greek and Cyrillic and are coming in 2020.

This typeface was funded by Google and is distributed by Google Fonts.
